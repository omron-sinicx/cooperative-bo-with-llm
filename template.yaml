overview: |
  Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designerâ€™s experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

  - title: Markdown examples
    text: |
      Here's our demo text showcasing the power of markdown and KaTeX integration!
      Markdown allows you to easily format text using simple syntax.
      - **bold**
      - *italic*
      - `inline code`.

      You can also create headings of various levels:
      # Heading Level 1
      ## Heading Level 2
      ### Heading Level 3
      #### Heading Level 4
      Markdown allows you to create tables like the following:
      #### Motion Planning (MP) Dataset
      markdown version
      |Method|Opt|Exp|Hmean|
      |--|--|--|--|
      |BF| 65.8 (63.8, 68.0)| 44.1 (42.8, 45.5) | 44.8 (43.4, 46.3)|
      |WA*| 68.4 (66.5, 70.4)| 35.8 (34.5, 37.1) | 40.4 (39.0, 41.8)|
      |**Neural A*** | **87.7 (86.6, 88.9)**| 40.1 (38.9, 41.3) | 52.0 (50.7, 53.3)|

      Of course, you can also directly write tables in HTML if needed. For more details, refer to the [UIKit Table documentation](https://getuikit.com/docs/table).
